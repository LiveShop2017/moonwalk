Overview: Mainly about the recognition, state estimation and threat degree estimation of multi-target basing on the interaction of human and computer 

## Recognition of multi-target 

Recognition of pre-processed target images by RBF neural network

The recognition of the four types of targets was performed, and the accuracy of the final trained neural network for target recognition was around 91.7%.


## State estimation of multi-target

Estimate the states of multiple targets using GM-PHD filtering algorithm.


## Threat degree estimation of multi-target

Threat degree estimation of multiple targets through information including type, position, velocity, and direction of movement of the target.
