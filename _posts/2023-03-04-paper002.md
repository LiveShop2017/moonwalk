This paper focuses on a distributed event-triggered Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filtering algorithm. With this algorithm, sensors transmit their Gaussian components to their neighbors  basing on the event-triggering conditions, and finally perform certain times fusion by matrix reformulation. The existence of the upper bound of the filtering error covariance is proved and the upper bound can be minimized by designing the filtering parameter at each time instant properly. This algorithm can reduce data transmission and energy consumption significantly without compromising the expected estimation performance. Simulation experiment evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm.

import microrequests

mr = microrequests.init()
# mr is requests' session object and you can use it in similar manner
res = mr.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
print(res.text)
