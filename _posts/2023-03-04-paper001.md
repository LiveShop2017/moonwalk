Time-varying formation tracking control problems for multi-agent systems using distributed multi-sensor multi-target filtering are investigated. In order to obtain the accurate state estimations of targets, a distributed multi-sensor multi-target filtering algorithm based on the cubature Kalman filter scheme and multiple heterogeneous sensors is proposed. Then, the state estimations obtained by the filtering algorithm are used to design a time-varying formation tracking protocol for multi-agent systems, enabling these systems to form a time-varying formation and track the convex combination of multiple targets. The estimation errors of filtering algorithm are proved to be bounded by introducing a stochastic process and the boundedness of the formation tracking errors is further proved by using the properties of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation experiments.

import microrequests

mr = microrequests.init()
# mr is requests' session object and you can use it in similar manner
res = mr.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
print(res.text)
