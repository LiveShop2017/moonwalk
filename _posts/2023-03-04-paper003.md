Formation tracking is used widely in targets enclosing, monitoring and striking, however, in practical scenes, the targets are always uncooperative. In this paper, the problem of time-varying formation tracking for multiagent with multi-target which states are unknown is studied. In order to obtain the accurate state estimations of targets, a distributed multi-sensor multi-target filtering algorithm based on the cubature Kalman filter scheme and multiple heterogeneous sensors is proposed. Then, the state estimations obtained by the filtering algorithm are used to design a time-varying formation tracking protocol for multiagent, enabling multiagent to form a time-varying formation and track the convex combination of targets. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation experiments.

import microrequests

mr = microrequests.init()
# mr is requests' session object and you can use it in similar manner
res = mr.get("http://httpbin.org/get")
print(res.text)
