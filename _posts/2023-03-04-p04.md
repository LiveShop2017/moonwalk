Overview: UAV navigation point positioning method based on scene matching

UAV aircraft has been developing rapidly in recent years, because of its strong mobility, light weight, low cost, better aerodynamic performance, and enable pilots to avoid danger and other advantages, has become the current development of the hot spot and trend.In the current development goals, the research of UAV navigation point positioning method based on scene matching is also a very important research direction.Due to the strong dependence of UAV on GPS signals, this paper compares several algorithms to find a better method for UAV scene matching and navigation point positioning, hoping to reduce the dependence of navigation system on GPS.

In this paper, a method based on orb and flann algorithm is proposed to extract feature points and locate navigation points through calculation.
Firstly, the orb algorithm was used to detect the feature points, and then the flann algorithm was used to match the feature points. Finally, the homography matrix and the pixel position of the template image center point in the real-time image were used to calculate the longitude, latitude and error distance of UAV positioning.By optimizing the algorithm, a fast and efficient program is obtained to achieve better positioning.
