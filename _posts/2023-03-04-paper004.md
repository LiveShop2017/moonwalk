This paper proposes a distributed cooperative detection method based on Pseudo Linear Kalman Filter (PLKF) for heterogeneous sensors to solve the shortcomings of active location tracking and the limitations of homogeneous sensor detection in electronic warfare environment. In this method, PLKF is used as the filtering method, radar-infrared sensor cooperative detection is adopted, and the corresponding distributed fusion algorithm is proposed, which integrates the multi-dimensional measurement information of sensor space-time registration, so as to achieve the high-precision and strong hiding detection of the target. Simulation results demonstrate the the rationality of this method and compares the influence of filtering algorithm and sensor model on detection accuracy. The results show that this method can construct an effective multi-sensor cooperative detection network, which can meet the requirements of strong anti-interference ability and high precision target detection.
